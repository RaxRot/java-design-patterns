# Java Design Patterns – Learning From Scratch

## Description
This repository is created for learning Java design patterns **from scratch**.

I am just starting to study this topic, so the repository may be empty or updated gradually as I learn new concepts and patterns.

---

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Learn what design patterns are
- Understand why they are used
- Study how they work in Java
- Practice step by step, from basic to more advanced patterns

---

## Current Status
🚧 Work in progress

At the moment, this repository is at the very beginning of the learning process.  
Code and examples will be added progressively during the study.

---

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## Notes
This is a learning repository.  
The focus is on understanding concepts rather than writing perfect or production-ready code.

---

## Goal
To build a basic understanding of Java design patterns and gradually improve backend development skills.
